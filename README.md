Text based Rpg game.  

 

I want to build a simple text-based game by myself mostly and try to figure out how to make a simple adventure using my own ideas and code if possible.  

 

Game (simple version)  

The simple verion of this game will start with a:  

Menu 

Character  

Two rooms  

An enemy (in the second room)  

 

In order to win the game, the player will need to:  

Walk into the first room and answer the question 

Walk into the second room and defeat the enemy 

 

Classes:  

Game (menu , rooms , character , enemy)
